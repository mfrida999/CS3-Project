GAME: SLIME
GOAL: Get to the end without dying. You can die by hitting a thorny wall or losing too much mass. You can grab pickups that replenish your mass along the way. There are checkpoints to help you through.
ABILITY 1: jump
Point and click to jump. You can only jump once every 5 seconds or every time you are stuck to a wall. 
Pro tip: You can click and hold to slow down time while aiming your jump.
Note: Players often try to jump through corners of walls. This is not possible. You must jump AWAY from a wall, not along or into it.
ABILITY 2: grapple
Point and press spacebar to grapple. Note: If the grapple is not strong enough to pull you away from the wall, you will simply stay stuck and the grapple will disappear. This happens if you accrue too much mass or grapple to something too close to you.
SHORTCUTS:
‘R’ to respawn at last checkpoint
‘L’ to skip to the end and play the game winning cutscene
